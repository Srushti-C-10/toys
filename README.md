# Overview

![PowerToys header image](./doc/images/overview/PT%20hero%20image.png)

Microsoft PowerToys is a set of utilities for power users to tune and streamline their Windows experience for greater productivity. Inspired by the [Windows 95 era PowerToys project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerToys), this reboot provides power users with ways to squeeze more efficiency out of the Windows 10 shell and customize it for individual workflows.  A great overview of the Windows 95 PowerToys can be found [here](https://socket3.wordpress.com/2016/10/22/using-windows-95-powertoys/).

## Current PowerToy Utilities

### FancyZones

<img align="left" src="./doc/images/overview/FancyZones_small.png" />[FancyZones](/src/modules/fancyzones/) is a window manager that makes it easy to create complex window layouts and quickly position windows into those layouts.

### Shortcut Guide

<img align="left" src="./doc/images/overview/Shortcut guide_small.png" />[Windows key shortcut guide](/src/modules/shortcut_guide) appears when a user holds the Windows key down for more than one second and shows the available shortcuts for the current state of the desktop.

<br>

### PowerRename

<img align="left" src="./doc/images/overview/PowerRename_small.PNG" />[PowerRename](/src/modules/powerrename) is a Windows Shell Extension for advanced bulk renaming using search and replace or regular expressions. PowerRename allows simple search and replace or more advanced regular expression matching. While you type in the search and replace input fields, the preview area will show what the items will be renamed to. PowerRename then calls into the Windows Explorer file operations engine to perform the rename. This has the benefit of allowing the rename operation to be undone after PowerRename exits. This code is based on [Chris Davis's SmartRename](https://github.com/chrdavis/SmartRename).

### File Explorer (Preview Panes)

<img align="left" src="./doc/images/overview/PowerPreview_small.PNG" />[File Explorer](/src/modules/previewpane) add-ons right now are just limited to Preview Pane additions for File Explorer. Preview Pane is an existing feature in the File Explorer.  To enable it, you just click the View tab in the ribbon and then click "Preview Pane".

PowerToys will now enable two types of files to be previewed: Markdown (.md) & SVG (.svg)
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Image Resizer

<img align="left" src="./doc/images/overview/ImageResizer_small.png" />[Image Resizer](/src/modules/imageresizer) is a Windows Shell Extension for quickly resizing images.  With a simple right click from File Explorer, resize one or many images instantly. This code is based on [Brice Lambson's Image Resizer](https://github.com/bricelam/ImageResizer).

This is our preferred method.

### Other install methods

## What's Happening

### April 2020 Update

Our goals for 0.17 release cycle were updatability and stability.

**Auto-updating:** We just added in the code for doing updating, so the first chance to experience this will be when 0.18 is released. We‚Äôre also seeing how aggressive everyone wants with this so right now, you‚Äôll have to click ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù for it to kick off the installer. This is something we‚Äôd love feedback on.

Another thing we did was utilized telemetry from PowerToys to prioritize virtual desktop FancyZone work. We knew there was a subset of bugs caused by an underlying issue and seeing how many users it affected helped us reprioritize to do the work sooner.

- We shipped [v0.17][github-release-link]!
- Auto-updating
- FancyZone improvement:
  - Virtual desktop support should be much better!
  - Better taskbar positioning
- Fixed non-admin install regression.
- Lots of bug fixes!

For [0.18](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+project%3Amicrosoft%2FPowerToys%2F4), we are proactively working on:

- Win+R replacement (Launcher)
- Keyboard remapping
- Performance improvements with FancyZones
- A testing utility for FancyZones to be sure we can test different window configurations.
- Settings v2 / Fix bug #243

### ‚ö† State of code ‚ö†
