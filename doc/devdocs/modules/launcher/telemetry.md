# Telemetry
## Overview
`PowerLauncher.Telemetry` project contains telemetry events generated by `PowerToys Run.` These event classes are derived from the `EventBase` class and `IEvent` class. `IEvent` class provides the lowest level abstraction, containing attributes such as privacy tags needed for every telemetry data. `EventBase` class provides a higher-level abstraction, having attributes common to all `PowerToys Run` telemetry events.

## Events
The following events are generated by `PowerToys Run`: 
1. `LauncherBootEvent`: This event captures the time taken by `PowerLauncher` to load all plugins, perform cold start, and setup UI environment. 
2. `LauncherHideEvent`: This event is generated when the `PowerLauncher` window is hidden.
3. `LauncherColdStateHotkeyEvent`: This event logs time from the first Alt+Space press till the `PowerLauncher` window is visible.
4. `LauncherFirstDeleteEvent`: This event is generated after the first delete is pressed after `PowerLauncher` is visible.
5. `LauncherQueryEvent`: This event is generated for every query that is typed in the searchbox. It logs query time, number of results, and query length.
6. `LauncherResultActionEvent`: This event is generated when a context menu action is triggered.
7. `LauncherShowEvent`: This event is generated when the `PowerLauncher` window is shown.
8. `LauncherWarmStateHotkeyEvent`: This event logs time from the Alt+Space press until the PT Run window is visible.
