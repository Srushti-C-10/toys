## Web Search Plugin
The Web Search Plugin, as the name suggests, is used to perform a web search - in the default search engine in the default browser - on the query that has been entered by the user.

## Default Browser Icon
- The icon for each web search result is that of the default browser set by the user.
- It, and the browser path, are obtained from the user registry and updated each time the theme of PT Run is changed.
