# Project Structure
## Overview
`PT Run` is divided across several projects to keep a logical seperation between plugins and core functionalities. The following sections provide a brief overview of each project.

## Project Description
#### `PowerLauncher`
This is the startup project for the `PT Run`. It is a WPF desktop application and follows `Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)` design pattern. Plugins play the role of `model` and provide data to viewModel. The UI architecure has been discussed in detail here. 

#### `PowerLauncher.Telemetry`
`PowerLauncher.Telemetry` is a .net core project contains telemetry events generated by `PowerToys Run`. These event classes are derived from `EventBase` class and `IEvent` class. `IEvent` class provides lowest level abstraction, containing attributes such as privacy tags, needed for every telemetry data. `EventBase` class provides a higher level abstraction, containing attributes common to all `PowerToys Run` telemetry event.

#### `Wox.Core`
`Wox.Core` is a .net core project that contains helper classes required by `PowerLauncher` project. Two major functionalities encapsulated in this project are `PluginManager` and `Query Builder`. `PluginManager` provides an interface for managing C# plugins. `Query Builder` decimate user-typed query string and creates a `Query` object. `Query` object contains information such as action keyword, and cleaned query which is then sent to all plugins.

#### `Wox.Infrastructure`
`Wox.Infrastructure` is a .net core project that contains helper classes required by `PowerLauncher` project and the plugins. Major functionalities implemented in this project are explained below.

###### Logging
`Log.cs` provides an abstraction for logging error, information and output to text files. These files are stored at `%userprofile%/appdata/local/microsoft/powertoys/powertoys run/Logs` for each `PowerToys Run` version. `Log.cs` internally uses `NLog`, a .net standard library to write logs to files.

###### Storage




#### `Wox.Plugin` 
`Wox.Plugin` contains interfaces that facilitate communication between `PowerLauncher` and plugins. These interfaces have been discussed in detail here.
