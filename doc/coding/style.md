# Coding Style

## Philosophy
1. If it's inserting something into the existing classes/functions, try to follow the existing style as closely as possible.
1. If it's brand new code or refactoring a complete class or area of the code, please follow as Modern C++ of a style as you can and reference the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines) as much as you possibly can.
