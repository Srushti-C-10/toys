<img align="right" src="./images/Logo.png" />

- **What is it:** Post-install prompted dialog that walks new users through PowerToys basic functionalities and customizations
- **Author:** Deondre Davis
- **Spec Status:** Draft

## 1. Overview

### 1.1. Executive Summary

PowerToys suffers from the lack of a guided post-install experience. Without this, it is virtually impossible for new users to quickly get started with PowerToys due to the need to dig through documentation to understand how to use it. The proceeding document proposes the creation of a post-install prompt that introduces users to the various PowerToys and offers helpful insights and engaging customization options to users who normally would not look through the documentation.

### 1.2. Key Definition/Concept

Here we define the key acronym found throughout this document to ensure clarity:

- **OOBE:** Out of box experience – The users’ initial interactions with the product immediately after installing the product and/or launching the product for the first time.

### 1.3. Goals and Non-Goals

Goals:

- Create a guided prompt that exposes the user to a brief overview of each PowerToy, highlighting the PowerToys’ basic usage.
- Present a short-list of useful customization options that the user can select to define their experience.

Non-goals:

- Present an exhaustive list of features and options that are available in PowerToys. This OOBE prompt is only meant to provide initial exposure for which interested users should continue investigating via provided links to documentation and settings.

## 2. Definition of Success

### 2.1. Customers

The PowerToys OOBE is for new power users and developers who are looking to tune and streamline their Windows experience for greater productivity and enhanced user experience. As the PowerToys customer base tends to be particularly biased against OOBE prompts in general, we need to present the PowerToys OOBE dialog in such a way that it provides immediate value to end-users to improve the likelihood of users discovering all the PowerToys by completing the prompts.

### 2.2. Expected Impact: Customer, and Technology Outcomes

- **High Reliability:** Less than 0.1% crash rate.
- **Increased Activation:** 30% or more increase in usage in all PowerToys features.
- **High User Retention:** 25% or more active PowerToys users after 28 days.
- **High OOBE Engagement Rate** PowerToys users click through at least half of the available OOBE sections.
